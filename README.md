# Decision Analytics Toolkit (Java)

A Java-based decision-support tool designed to help small businesses analyze profitability, understand cost structures, and evaluate pricing scenarios using real sales data.

Instead of building a traditional CRUD application, this project focuses on **business analytics and decision-making logic**, translating raw data into actionable insights.

## Business Problem

Small businesses often collect sales data but lack the tools to answer key questions such as:
- Which products are truly profitable?
- How many units must be sold to break even?
- How would pricing changes impact overall profit?

This toolkit provides a structured way to evaluate those questions using financial metrics and scenario analysis.
